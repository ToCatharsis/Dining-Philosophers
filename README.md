# Dining philosophers problem
Author: Ivan Ryzhankow

University JAVA project which simulates a dining philosophers problem.
There are 5 threads which represents philosophers and 5 forks. Each 
philosopher thinks fo some time, after that he feels hungry and need 2
forks and some time to eat. This simulation allows avoiding deadlocks,
but doesn't solve the problem of starving.
